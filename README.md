## History of Perfect Money  
### From Centralization to Decentralization

**Perfect Money: The Centralized Era**  
Founded in 2007, Perfect Money began as a centralized digital payment system enabling instant payments, currency exchange, and merchant solutions. While effective, this centralized model required users to trust a single authority—leading to concerns such as account freezes, limited transparency, and restricted user autonomy.
